# Interactive coding materials

The lessons contain R code for you to execute / run.

Typically you would download the data / code files to your local machine (e.g., laptop).

However you can complete the lessons online without the need to install or download anything. Simply click on the relevant link below.

Please click the *Open in Colab* link; you may need to login / register for a free Google account to run the code.
